          My name is Aidan Hanna, and I am a recent graduate with a degree in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering from 
          Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Iâ€™m a passionate programmer and electrical engineer looking to gain professional 
          experience. I love working across different levels of abstraction in hardware and software alike, and there is nothing 
          more satisfying to me than solving a difficult problem. I am currently seeking a full-time position in the Greater 
          Boston Area. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out to me by email (see links in footer). Thank you!

        <p class='text-block'>
          This website serves as an interactive resume and a place for me to showcase my work. I created everything myself using HTML, 
          CSS, and Javascript. It is currently a work in progress and will continue to be updated with new content and functionality 
          over time. The source code for this website is all available at
