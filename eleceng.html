        <p class='text-block'>This class refreshed basic circuit components and analysis techniques such as Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws. It 
          also covered more advanced components like operational amplifiers and analysis techniques like Laplace transforms and nodal/mesh 
          analysis.This class also had a heavy influence on problem solving and circuit design to meet certain parameters. I designed and 
          implemented an original circuit design along with my partner intended to increase the efficiency of solar panels. Throughout the 
          semester we designed, tested, implemented, and integrated pieces of the circuit to create the final system. More information 
          about the project can be found

        <h2 class='subheading'>Embedded Control</h2>
        <p class='text-block'>This class covered all of the knowledge and skills required to use a Silicon Labs C8051F020 microcontroller. 
          We covered microcontroller components and functions like the crossbar, clock/timers, analog to digital converters, and the 
          SMbus/I2Cbus, and relevant and associated concepts like pulse-width modulation, and parallel and serial communication. Since the 
          labs were unable to be done in person due to COVID-19, I did construct the relevant circuits for the lab. While under normal 
          circumstances students would construct a remote-controlled car of sorts, we used a simulated version. This allowed us to run our 
          C code remotely. While the simulation may have had its drawbacks, it also allowed for us to solve problems that we otherwise may 
          not have encountered like random steady state errors which required a dynamic approach in the simulator, requiring a more thorough 
          understanding of PID control.</p>
