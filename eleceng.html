        <p class='text-block'>This class covered basic circuit components and analysis techniques such as Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws. It 
          also covered more advanced components such as operational amplifiers and analysis techniques like Laplace transforms and nodal/mesh 
          analysis. This class also had a heavy influence on problem solving and circuit design to meet certain parameters. I designed and 
          implemented an original circuit intended to increase the efficiency of solar panels. Throughout the semester my partner and I designed, 
          tested, implemented, and integrated pieces of the circuit to create the final system. More information about the project can be found

        <h2 class='subheading'>Embedded Control</h2>
        <p class='text-block'>This class covered all of the knowledge and skills required to use a Silicon Labs C8051F020 microcontroller. We covered 
          microcontroller components and functions such as the crossbar, clock/timers, analog to digital converters, and the SMbus/I2Cbus, and relevant 
          and associated concepts like pulse-width modulation, and parallel and serial communication. Since the labs were held remotely due to COVID-19, 
          I did not construct the relevant circuits for the lab. While under normal circumstances students would construct a remote-controlled car of 
          sorts, we used a simulated version. This allowed us to run our C code remotely. While the simulation may have had its drawbacks, it also 
          allowed us to solve problems we otherwise would not have encountered. For example, we dealt with random steady-state errors by applying 
          a dynamic approach in the simulator, requiring a more thorough understanding of PID control.</p>
