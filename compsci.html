        <p class='text-block'>I have been programming in C++ for over two years. My introduction to C++ was through online tutorials. 
          These taught me the basics of the language, and since it was my first programming language, they taught me the basics of 
          programming as a whole as well. My most recent experience is a class on data structures taught in C++. This class reinforced 
          the fundamentals of the language while teaching me new skills, and the enforcement of strict coding standards prepared me to 
          work more effectively in groups such as those encountered in a professional setting.</p>

        <p class='text-block'>I have learned HTML through online tutorials - primarily codecademy - and the use of reference websites 
          and documentation. My primary use of HTML has been the creation of the structure and content of this website. All of the files
