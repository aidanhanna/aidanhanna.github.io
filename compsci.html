      <p class='page-description'>Through coursework and independent study I have learned a wide variety of languages, from high-level, 
        dynamically-typed, and interpreted python to lower-level, statically-typed, and compiled C++. Below is a compilation of every 
        language I have learned, how I learned it, and when I’ve used it.</p>
      
      <div class='content-block'>
        <h2 class='subheading'>C++</h2>
        <p class='text-block'>Online C++ tutorials were my first introduction to programming. These taught me the basics of the language, 
          and since it was my first programming language, they taught me the basics of programming as a whole as well. My most recent C++ 
          experience is a course on data structures which covered structures as simple as arrays and vectors to B-plus trees and hash maps. 
          This course reinforced the fundamentals of the language while teaching me new skills, and the enforcement of stricter coding 
          standards prepared me to work more effectively in groups which has proved helpful in projects I’ve worked on with friends or 
          needed help debugging. Due to my familiarity with the language, C++ is my preferred language for most projects. A small sample
          of my work is available 
          <a class='link' href='https://github.com/aidanhanna/aidanhanna.github.io/tree/main/files/PascalTriangle' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>.</p>

      <div class='content-block'>
        <h2 class='subheading'>C</h2>
        <p class='text-block'>My primary experience with C is its application in control systems for microcontrollers, specifically the 
          Silicon Labs C8051F020 microcontroller. I used C for projects as simple as configuring inputs and outputs for a switch to control 
          an LED and projects as complicated as creating a multi-state steering system using PID control. This gave me a solid grasp of 
          control systems as well as C as a whole.</p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div class='content-block'>
        <h2 class='subheading'>Python</h2>
        <p class='text-block'>My Computer Science I class taught python from the fundamentals to more advanced topics. This was my first 
          formal computer science class and as such began my education on subjects like readability and efficiency, very important concepts 
          that had previously been neglected. Python is my preferred language for quick prototyping or repeated calculations due to the ease 
          and brevity of its syntax. Because we used the pillow module in class, python is also the language I turn to for creating things 
          like the banner image at the top of each page was created using various features of the pillow module. The files for this project
          are available 
          <a class='link' href='https://github.com/aidanhanna/aidanhanna.github.io/tree/main/files/BannerGenerator' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>.</p>

        <h2 class='subheading'>HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p class='text-block'>I have paired HTML and CSS together as they are very reliant on each other. HTML provides a website’s 
          content, css provides its style, and they come together to form its structure. My main experience with HTML and CSS is the 
          creation of this website, the HTML and CSS files for which can be found 
          <a href='https://github.com/aidanhanna/aidanhanna.github.io' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a> and 
          <a href='https://github.com/aidanhanna/aidanhanna.github.io/tree/main/css' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>, respectively.</p>

      <div class='content-block'>
        <h2 class='subheading'>Javascript</h2>
        <p class='text-block'>I have learned javascript to create dynamic features for this website. It has been used for the dropdown 
          navigation at the top of each page and for the collapsing of the classes page to allow for the pages of this website to stay 
          significantly more compact and streamlined. While not strictly necessary, it greatly enhances the functionality of this website. 
          In the future, I hope to use javascript to create small-scale games that would be available to play on this website.</p>
